episode-bookmarker
==================

This script keeps track of watched episodes.

I created it so I could have a simple way of keeping track of what I was watching. My old method of symlinking to the next unwatched episode was annoying, and I found things like XBMC to be overkill. Thus, this script was created.

Run the script with no arguments to see the usage.
